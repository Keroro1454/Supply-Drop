# It's time to receive...a Supply Drop!
Supply Drop is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 designed to add a number of items.
Items are designed with not just variety in mind, but with the goal of staying true to the game's design aesthetic, as well as balance.
More items are coming soon, as fast as I can figure out how to make them (and suffer through the modeling process).

# Included Items:
## Common Items:
- **Hardened Bone Fragments**
	- Gain .5 (+.5 per stack) armor on kill. All armor is lost upon taking damage.
