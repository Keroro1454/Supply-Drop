# It's time to receive...a Supply Drop!
Supply Drop is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 designed to add a number of items.
Items are designed with not just variety in mind, but with the goal of staying true to the game's design aesthetic, as well as balance.
More items are coming soon--over a dozen are planned as of now!

# What's New with Update 1.2: Shield Your Eyes!
For millennia man has pondered over some of the toughest questions life has to offer. What's the point of it all? Do I matter? Do people actually use Google Stadia? And most importantly of all:

Why in the world would anyone pick up more than one Personal Shield Generator?

Thing is, the fact man puzzled over that last one is a testament to how dumb man is. Because the answer is that there is no reason, ever. UNTIL TODAY THAT IS! THAT'S RIGHT, SHIELD ISN'T USELESS ANYMORE! Introducing the Shield Your Eyes update, coming to the Supply Drop mod! This update will bring...no you idiot, it's just the title of the update, don't literally cover your eyes.

Okay. They're open now? Good. Then...BEHOLD! Four brand new items: Two commons, one uncommon, and one egendary, all centered around the shield mechanic. And yes, you read that right. FOUR new items, which is 100% more than the last update, making this an objectively superior update! This update has brought the items, now you go bring purpose to the life of that sad, lonely second Personal Shield Generator you've left behind on all those stages in the past. You monster.
